# Report-Card
Google Android Basics Nano degree's 5th project, Udacity. 
The goal is to design and create the structure of a ReportCard Java Class which would allow a school to store a student’s grades for a particular year. This project will be just a java class, rather than a full Android app.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Designing a custom class
Creating that class in Java code.
Storing information in an array
Looping through an array
